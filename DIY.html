           <h1>DIY PROJECT</h1>
           <h3>How to Make Transparent Frames?</h3>
            <img id="DIYpicture" src="img/cerceve.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="DIYtext"><p><b>Elastic Transparent Frame</b>
            </p>Again, there was a decoration trend on my agenda that has been popular for a while. Although it has been popular for a while, when I saw that the prices in the stores did not decrease, I decided to compile a few do-it-yourself ideas. I prepared two different transparent frame projects for my renovated living room. Since both are very easy to make, you can try whichever you like. The best part of transparent frames is that both sides are transparent.
              <p> The best part of transparent frames is that they offer a much more elegant and minimalist look as both sides are transparent. In this way, whatever you put in the frame, the result is quite beautiful. I put dried leaves and white bird feathers in the first frames I made. With the arrival of spring, the dried autumn leaves gave way to dried daisies.</p> 
               
              <p>You can make thematic arrangements inside transparent frames. For example, you can keep old notes with black and white photos and dried flowers as a keepsake of the moment. It is possible to increase the examples, but first let me explain the construction of two different transparent frames. </p>
                <p>

                </p> <p><b>Materials</b>

                 <p><b>1.</b>  Thick packing tires</p> 
                 <p><b>2.</b>  2 old frame glasses</p>   
                 <p><b>3.</b>  Chain for hanging</p>   
                    </p>
                    <p>I used glass that I removed from two identically sized frames. If you do not have two glass frames of the same size, you can find them on the Internet at affordable prices.</p>

                      <p>  What you need to do is to pass the rubber bands on the four sides of the glass and attach a chain to the top if you want to hang them on the wall. By the way, the frame will look very nice with its legs or leaning against the wall.</p>

            <h3>How to Make a Sun Mirror from Garbage Skewers?            </h3>
            <img id="DIYpicture" src="img/ayna.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="DIYtext"><p><b>Elastic Transparent Frame</b>
            </p>I always like to make fashionable pieces in decoration myself. It is possible to adapt accessories with very high prices, especially when they are in fashion, with simple steps. Daylight mirrors have been on my radar for a while. Small sizes were quite expensive at H&M Home. I haven't seen much cheaper than that.

              <p> The best part of transparent frames is that they offer a much more elegant and minimalist look as both sides are transparent. In this way, whatever you put in the frame, the result is quite beautiful. I put dried leaves and white bird feathers in the first frames I made. With the arrival of spring, the dried autumn leaves gave way to dried daisies.Even though I tried a mirror with thick skewers a while ago, the result was not exactly what I wanted. This time I made another experiment with thin stick skewers. I can share with you with peace of mind that I finally got the image I wanted. Now let's move on to the construction stages.</p> 
               
              <img id="DIYpictures" src="img/malz.jpg" alt="">
                <p>

                </p> <p><b>Materials</b>

                   <p>Stick skewers (I cut 16 cm)</p> 
                   <p>Gold color spray paint</p> 
                   <p>Scissors</p> 
                    <p>Transparent adhesive</p>
                  <p>paper clip</p>  
                   <p>silicone</p>  
                   <p>piece of cardboard</p> 
                  <p>Round mirror </p>  
                    <p>First of all, I put the round mirror on a cardboard and make a mold of the same size. I draw a circle in the middle of this pattern. There should be some space around the edges. The diameter of the mirror I used was 11 cm. I then size wooden skewers. I measure and cut all of them according to 16 cm. I can't give periods because the frequency is completely up to you.</p>
                     <p> With a clear adhesive, I first glue the skewers around the inner ring. Since the transparent adhesive takes a long time to dry, you can straighten the skewers with your hands at this stage.</p>
                    <p>When the first circle is finished, it is the turn of the outside circle. This time I'm starting to stick the skewers around this circle. Again, I continue the process by correcting it by hand. After it's done, let it dry and wait for the glue to set completely.</p>
                <p>After it dries, I turn it over and stick a paper clip. This paper clip will be your mirror hanger. I recommend sticking it tightly with hot glue and even smothering it with some silicone.</p>
