                </h5>
                <p>               Recycling with home decor crafts is a great way to save money and be environmentally friendly. Instead of buying something new and mass-produced, you can use your own two hands and create a piece that’s unique and special to you. Many of these craft ideas would fit right in with the items in a high-end decor shop. Instead, they are made with love and one-of-a-kind.</p>
